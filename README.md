# GHL-Claude

Tooling for the **University Of Options** GoHighLevel location, built on the
v2 API with a private integration token.

## Setup

Two environment variables, already set in this environment:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GHL_API_KEY` | Private integration token (`pit-…`). Legacy v1 keys are rejected. |
| `GHL_LOCATION_ID` | The sub-account this tooling is scoped to. |

The token is never read from a file or passed as an argument, and `.gitignore`
excludes credentials and exported CSVs (which contain personal data).

```bash
python3 cli.py info
```

## Commands

All commands here are **read-only**. Nothing sends an email, edits a contact,
or enrols anyone in a workflow.

```bash
python3 cli.py info                       # account summary
python3 cli.py tags --search newsletter   # find tags
python3 cli.py workflows --status published
python3 cli.py schedules                  # existing email campaign schedules
python3 cli.py count  --tag "weekly newsletter subscriber" --mailable
python3 cli.py export --tag "weekly newsletter subscriber" --mailable \
                      --out lists/newsletter.csv
```

`--tag` repeats to mean OR. `--mailable` is worth defaulting to for anything
email-bound: it drops contacts with no email address and contacts with DND set.

## Account snapshot

Verified live against the API on 2026-07-25:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Contacts | 48,977 |
| Mailable (has email, DND off) | 43,682 |
| Tags | 544 |
| Custom fields | 278 |
| Workflows | 366 |
| Email templates | 38 |

**5,295 contacts are not mailable** — 1,408 have no email address and 3,888
have DND enabled (one contact is both). Any bulk send must exclude them, which
is what `--mailable` does.

## What the API can and cannot do

Verified by probing the live endpoints:

| Goal | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Targeted lead lists | **Full support.** `POST /contacts/search` handles nested AND/OR groups, tag/date/field filters, and cursor pagination. |
| Bulk email scheduling | **Supported.** `/emails/schedule` and `/emails/builder` respond; campaign create/update/schedule endpoints exist. |
| Enrolling contacts in workflows | **Supported.** `POST /workflows/{id}/contacts/{contactId}`. |
| **Creating or editing workflows** | **Not possible.** Workflows are read-only in the public API — there is no endpoint for triggers, conditions, or actions. `POST /workflows/` returns 404. This is a [known open feature request](https://ideas.gohighlevel.com/apis/p/api-endpoints-post-put-del-for-workflows), not a gap in this tooling. |

Workflows still have to be built in the GHL UI. What is automatable is
everything around them — deciding who belongs in one and enrolling them in bulk.

## API behaviour worth knowing

- **Rate limits:** 100 requests per 10s burst, 200,000/day. `GHLClient`
  self-throttles below the burst ceiling and retries on 429/5xx with backoff.
- **Slow queries return `401 {"message":"Command timed out"}`** rather than a
  timeout status. This is transient and misleading — it is not an auth failure.
  The client retries it.
- **Pagination uses the `searchAfter` cursor**, not offsets; offset paging is
  capped server-side and silently truncates results.
- **Date filters run in the location's timezone, but `dateAdded` is returned in
  UTC.** A contact stamped `2026-07-25T06:03Z` is 23:03 on 2026-07-24 in
  America/Los_Angeles and will not match a range starting 2026-07-25. Segment by
  local dates rather than by the UTC timestamps that appear in CSV exports.

## Layout

```
ghl/client.py     authenticated client: throttling, retries, pagination
ghl/segments.py   filter helpers, mailability guard, CSV export
cli.py            read-only command line interface
```

## Writes

No write path is implemented yet, deliberately. An untested POST against
`/emails/schedule` would reach a real audience of tens of thousands. Write
support should land behind a dry-run default and an explicit confirmation flag.
